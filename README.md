# Tourist-Place-Recommendation-System
This project is a tourist place recommendation system that provides personalized recommendations for tourists based on their preferences and ratings from other users. It utilizes a collaborative filtering approach to find similar users and recommend popular tourist places based on their ratings.

Project Description:
The project aims to build a recommendation system for popular places  using user ratings. This system will help users discover new places  to visit based on their preferences and the preferences of other users.

1. Data Collection:
The project starts with data collection.  This dataset contains information about users, places, reviews, and ratings.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Data preprocessing is a critical step to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Data cleaning includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and dropping unnecessary columns.
The cleaned dataset is saved to a new CSV file named "cleaned_dataset.csv."

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset, such as rating distributions, popular places, and user preferences.

4. Data Modeling:
The dataset is transformed into a user-Place interaction matrix, where rows represent places, columns represent users, and the values are ratings.
Only places with a minimum total rating count (defined by "popularity_threshold") are retained to focus on popular places.
The resulting matrix is stored in the "Place_features_df" DataFrame.

6. Recommendation Model:
A recommendation model is built using a nearest neighbors algorithm. In this case, cosine similarity is used as the distance metric.
The model is trained on the user-Place interaction matrix to find similar places based on user preferences.

6. User Interaction:
Users are given the opportunity to select a place for which they want recommendations.
The system calculates recommendations based on the selected place, using the trained model and cosine similarity.

8. Output:
The system displays a list of recommended places for the selected place. This list is generated by finding places with similar user interactions and preferences.

Key Outputs:
Recommendations for a selected place based on user ratings and preferences.
The project allows users to explore new places and enrich their travel experiences.
The recommendation system can be used as part of a travel or exploration application or website.
